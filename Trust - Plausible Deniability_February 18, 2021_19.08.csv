Decisions With Money


Principal Investigator: Onyul Haque, Senior in Psychology Department

Faculty Advisor: Professor David Dunning, Psychology Department 

 

You are invited to participate in a research study about how people think about financial situations

 

If you agree to be part of the research study, you will be asked to read through a few scenarios dealing with money and make decisions based on those scenarios.

 

Benefits of the research: There are no direct benefits of participating in this study.

 

Risks and discomforts: The risks of this study are minimal. They are nothing more than you would experience in your daily life.

 

Compensation: You will receive 1/2 hour of research credit for your participation, assigned

to the class you indicate below. In addition, there is a chance to gain money in this study.

 

Participating in this study is completely voluntary.  Even if you decide to participate now, you may change your mind and stop at any time. You may choose not to skip any questions you find yourself too uncomfortable to answer for any reason.

 

Information collected in this project may be shared with other researchers, but we will not share any information that could identify you.

 

If you have questions about this research study, please contact Onyul Haque at ohaque@umich.edu or the faculty advisor, David Dunning, at ddunning@umich.edu.

In this scenario, there are two people (A and B).  Both have already been assigned to one another given the code number at the top of this page. Both will never know who the other person is, neither before, during, or after they make their decisions.  Thus, they interact with each other under conditions of total anonymity.



 

You are assigned to be Person A.

 

Person A gets $5 from the experimenter.  He or she has two options of what to do with that $5.

 

The two options of Person A:

 

Option 1: Person A can keep the $5.  In this case, Person B gets nothing.

 

Option 2: Person A can give the $5 to Person B.  In this case the experimenter adds another $15 so 

that Person B gets $20 in total

 

The two options of Person B:

 

Person B has two options with the $20 if Person A chooses Option 2 above (e.g., gives the $5).  Note that Person B must decide what to do with the $20 before knowing what Person A did (i.e., gave or kept the money).

 

Option 3:  Person B can keep the $20 for themselves and give $0 to Person A.

 

Option 4:  Person B can keep $10 for themselves and give $10 to Person A.",Timing - First Click,Timing - Last Click,Timing - Page Submit,Timing - Click Count,Timing - First Click,Timing - Last Click,Timing - Page Submit,Timing - Click Count,"In this situation, the experimenter gives you $5 and you have two options with what to do with that money.
